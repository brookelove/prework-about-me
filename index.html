      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>In a short sentence finding my longterm passion. I love to problem solve as well as understand why things work. To be a developer you have to solve puzzles either individually or with a team to get a task accomplished.There is a lot of creative freedom in developing even in the way someone decides to code. It can change from person to person while allows for the same output on screen but the innerworks are beautiful. I also love how excited I am when I see a code of mine run and work well.</p>
